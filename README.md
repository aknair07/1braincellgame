# 1 Brain Cell Game

This repository contains a small Python project created as part of a course exercise.  
The aim was to practise **basic Python coding skills** in a group setting, focusing on writing simple, working code rather than production-ready software.

## Overview

- A lightweight Python game made up of several scripts, including:
  - `main_game.py` â€“ the entry point to start the game
  - Supporting modules such as `graphics.py`, `messages.py`, and `game_mechanics.py`
- Designed to be **clear and readable** for someone learning Python.
- No advanced optimisation or frameworks required.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have **Python 3.8+** installed.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. From the project folder, run:

```bash
python main_game.py
```

## Learning Focus

This project was written to demonstrate:
- How to organise a small multi-file Python script
- Use of functions and control flow
- Collaboration on a simple exercise
- Adding comments to explain code behaviour

## Notes

- The code is intentionally simple and may not cover all edge cases.
- Improvements (such as more error handling, tests, or packaging) could be added later, but the purpose here is to show **entry-level understanding** of Python.
