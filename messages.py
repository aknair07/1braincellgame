introStory = '''Agent, you have found yourself trapped in a dimly lit room, your senses immediately alert to the gravity of your predicament. 
        The air felt heavy with the scent of dampness, and the only illumination came from a single flickering bulb hanging from the 
        ceiling. As you assess your surroundings, you realise that the room had no windows but had three doors, not knowing 
        where they lead to. Panic threatened to consume you, but years of training kicked in, and you forced yourself to remain calm, 
        and try to find a way to escape the confines of your captivity.'''
